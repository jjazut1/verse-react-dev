# PWA Deep Linking Test Guide

## Overview
This guide tests the enhanced PWA deep linking implementation using the **Static HTML Launch Interceptor** approach. The system now uses a dedicated `launch.html` file that loads instantly and intelligently handles PWA detection and routing without requiring React to load.

## New Static HTML Launch Interceptor Architecture

### How It Works
1. **Email Links**: All email links now point to `/launch.html?target=<destination>&token=<token>&pwa=<option>`
2. **Static HTML**: The `launch.html` file loads instantly (no React bundle required)
3. **PWA Detection**: Multiple detection methods including `getInstalledRelatedApps()` API
4. **Protocol Handlers**: Attempts custom `web+lumino://` protocol for direct PWA access
5. **Graceful Fallback**: Always falls back to browser routing with beautiful loading UI

### Link Structure
- **PWA Install**: `/launch.html?target=%2Fstudent&pwa=install`
- **Assignment**: `/launch.html?target=%2Fplay&token=<assignment-token>`
- **Dashboard**: `/launch.html?target=%2Fstudent`

### Key Advantages
- âš¡ **Instant Loading**: No React bundle required for interceptor
- ðŸŽ¯ **Better Detection**: Uses `navigator.getInstalledRelatedApps()` when available
- ðŸ“± **Universal Compatibility**: Works in all email clients and browsers
- ðŸ”„ **Reliable Fallback**: Always redirects to target destination
- ðŸŽ¨ **Beautiful UI**: Professional loading screen with status updates

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: PWA Not Installed
**Expected Behavior:**
1. Click any email link â†’ Opens `launch.html` instantly
2. Shows "Launching Lumino Learning..." with spinner
3. Status: "Checking for installed app..."
4. Status: "Opening in browser..."
5. Redirects to target destination in browser after 1 second

### Scenario 2: PWA Installed
**Expected Behavior:**
1. Click any email link â†’ Opens `launch.html` instantly
2. Shows "Launching Lumino Learning..." with spinner
3. Status: "App detected! Launching..."
4. Attempts protocol handler and PWA launch
5. Either opens in PWA or falls back to browser

### Scenario 3: iOS Testing
**Expected Behavior:**
1. Shows special iOS notice about manual app switching
2. Attempts PWA detection but acknowledges iOS limitations
3. Provides clear user guidance

## Test Steps

### Step 1: Test Launch Interceptor Directly
1. Open: `https://verse-dev-central.web.app/launch.html?target=%2Fstudent&pwa=install`
2. **Expected**: Beautiful loading screen, then redirects to student dashboard
3. Check browser console for debug logs

### Step 2: Create Test Assignment
1. Go to teacher dashboard
2. Create new assignment for student
3. Student receives email with new `launch.html` URLs

### Step 3: Test Without PWA
1. Ensure PWA is NOT installed
2. Click "ðŸŽ® Start Assignment Now" from email
3. **Expected**: 
   - Instant `launch.html` loading screen
   - "Checking for installed app..." status
   - "Opening in browser..." status
   - Redirects to assignment in browser

### Step 4: Install PWA
1. Click "ðŸ“± Install Lumino Learning App" from email
2. **Expected**: 
   - Instant `launch.html` loading screen
   - Redirects to `/student?pwa=install`
   - PWA installation prompt appears
3. Install the PWA app

### Step 5: Test With PWA Installed
1. Click "ðŸŽ® Start Assignment Now" from email
2. **Expected**: 
   - Instant `launch.html` loading screen
   - "App detected! Launching..." status
   - Attempts to open in PWA app
   - Falls back to browser if needed

### Step 6: Protocol Handler Testing
1. With PWA installed, click assignment link
2. Check browser console for protocol attempts
3. **Expected**: See `web+lumino://` protocol attempts in logs

## Debugging Information

### Browser Console Logs
Look for these console messages:
- `[Launch Interceptor] Launch interceptor loaded`
- `[Launch Interceptor] URL params: {"target":"/play","token":"..."}`
- `[Launch Interceptor] Target URL: https://...`
- `[Launch Interceptor] PWA Detection - Standalone: false, Navigator: false, Android: false`
- `[Launch Interceptor] getInstalledRelatedApps found 0 apps`
- `[Launch Interceptor] Trying protocol: web+lumino://play?token=...`

### Launch Interceptor Status Messages
The interceptor shows real-time status:
- "Checking for installed app..."
- "App detected! Launching..."
- "Opening in browser..."
- "Taking longer than expected..."

### PWA Detection Methods
The system uses multiple detection methods:
1. `navigator.getInstalledRelatedApps()` (Chrome/Android)
2. `window.matchMedia('(display-mode: standalone)')`
3. `window.navigator.standalone` (iOS)
4. `document.referrer.includes('android-app://')`

## Known Limitations

### Email Client Restrictions
- âœ… **Solved**: No JavaScript restrictions (static HTML)
- âœ… **Solved**: No React bundle loading delays
- âœ… **Solved**: Works in all email clients

### Browser Variations
- **Chrome**: Best PWA support, `getInstalledRelatedApps()` available
- **Safari**: Limited PWA support, but interceptor works
- **Firefox**: Limited PWA support, but interceptor works
- **Edge**: Good PWA support on Windows

### Platform Differences
- **iOS**: PWA links often open in Safari first (expected behavior)
- **Android**: Better PWA integration with Chrome
- **Desktop**: Most reliable PWA link handling

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Success âœ…
- âœ… All links work in browser (fallback always works)
- âœ… Launch interceptor loads instantly
- âœ… Beautiful loading UI with status updates
- âœ… PWA installation works from email links

### Optimal Success ðŸŽ¯
- âœ… Assignment links attempt to open in PWA when installed
- âœ… Dashboard links attempt to open in PWA when installed
- âœ… Protocol handlers work for direct PWA access
- âœ… `getInstalledRelatedApps()` detection on supported browsers
- âœ… Seamless transition: email â†’ launch.html â†’ PWA/browser

## Troubleshooting

### Launch Interceptor Not Loading
1. Check if `launch.html` exists in public folder
2. Verify build includes the file
3. Test direct URL: `/launch.html?target=%2Fstudent`

### Links Always Open in Browser
1. Check browser console for PWA detection logs
2. Verify PWA is properly installed
3. Test `getInstalledRelatedApps()` support in browser
4. Clear browser cache and reinstall PWA

### Protocol Handler Not Working
1. Verify `web+lumino:` protocol is registered in manifest
2. Check browser support for protocol handlers
3. Look for iframe creation in console logs
