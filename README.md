### Data Storage Strategy
```typescript
interface CategoryItem {
  content: string;  // Rich HTML: "<em>italicize</em>"
  text: string;     // Plain text: "italicize"
}
```
- **Dual Storage**: Rich HTML content + extracted plain text for game compatibility
- **Backward Compatibility**: Seamless migration from legacy plain text format
- **Rich Categories**: New `richCategories` format with fallback to legacy `categories`
