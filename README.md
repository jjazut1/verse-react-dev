## üõ†Ô∏è Rich Text Architecture

### Cross-Platform Rendering Engine
Our rich text system supports multiple rendering environments:

- **SVG Rendering (Spinner Wheel)**: Custom `renderRichTextSVG()` function with `tspan` positioning
  - Solved cumulative `dy` offset issues for proper super/subscript character spacing
  - Handles mid-word scripts like "H‚ÇÇO" and "Option‚Åµ" with precise positioning
  
- **3D Canvas Rendering (Whack-a-Mole)**: Direct canvas text rendering with rich formatting
  - HTML parsing with styled canvas text drawing
  - Dynamic font sizing and positioning for scripts
  - Character spacing calculations for complex formulas

- **CSS/HTML Rendering (Sort Categories)**: Native browser rendering with React components
  - `RichText` components with CSS `verticalAlign` for super/subscript
  - Preserved formatting through drag-and-drop operations

### Data Storage Strategy
```typescript
interface CategoryItem {
  content: string;  // Rich HTML: "<em>italicize</em>"
  text: string;     // Plain text: "italicize"
}
```
- **Dual Storage**: Rich HTML content + extracted plain text for game compatibility
- **Backward Compatibility**: Seamless migration from legacy plain text format
- **Rich Categories**: New `richCategories` format with fallback to legacy `categories`
