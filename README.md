- No fallback system for failed audio loads
- Overwhelming sound effects disrupting learning

**✅ Enhanced Audio Architecture**:
```typescript
// Fixed Audio Paths
const AUDIO_FILES = {
  bounce: '/sounds/cardboard.mp3',    // ✅ Wall collisions only
  // Removed: correct, wrong, levelUp, gameOver sounds
};

// Web Audio API Fallbacks
const playFallbackSound = (soundKey: string) => {
  const audioContext = new AudioContext();
  const oscillator = audioContext.createOscillator();
  // Programmatic sound generation when files fail
};
```

**🎯 Focused Audio Experience**:

### 🔧 **CRITICAL SYSTEM FIXES & COMPLETE GAME LIBRARY** (January 2025) ✅

#### **🛠️ FIRESTORE PERMISSION RESOLUTION & WORD VOLLEY INTEGRATION**

**✨ SYSTEM STABILIZATION**: Successfully resolved critical Firestore permission errors that were preventing user authentication and completed the game library with the addition of Word Volley as the 7th game.

#### **📊 Recent Fixes & Improvements**

| Component | Issue | Resolution | Status |
|-----------|-------|------------|---------|
| **Firestore Security Rules** | Circular permission dependency | Allow users to read own documents | ✅ Fixed |
| **Authentication System** | Missing or insufficient permissions | User role detection now working | ✅ Fixed |
| **Word Volley Game** | Unsupported game type warning | Added to supported games list | ✅ Complete |
| **Game Library** | 6 of 7 games available | All 7 games now operational | ✅ Complete |

#### **🔐 Critical Permission Fix**

**🚨 Root Cause**: Firestore security rules created a circular dependency where users needed to be teachers/admins to read user documents, but the system needed to read user documents to determine if they were teachers/admins.

**💡 Solution**: Updated security rules to allow users to read their own documents while maintaining proper access control:
```javascript
// Before: Only teachers/admins could read user documents
allow read: if isAuthenticated() && (isTeacherOrAdmin() || isAdmin());

// After: Users can read their own documents + teachers/admins can read others
allow read: if isAuthenticated() && (
  request.auth.uid == userId ||  // Users can read their own document
  isTeacherOrAdmin() || 
  isAdmin()
);
```

**🎯 Impact**: 
- ✅ **Authentication Working**: Google login and user role detection now functional
- ✅ **Database Access**: All game fetching and template loading operational
