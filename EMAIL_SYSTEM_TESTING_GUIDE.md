# Email System Testing Guide

## 📧 Testing Student Credential Setup Email System

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for testing the email-based student credential setup functionality after the Google Workspace migration to `luminatelearn.com`.

## 🎯 Pre-Testing Checklist

### ✅ Required Configuration
- [ ] Firebase secrets configured with new domain
- [ ] SendGrid domain verification for `luminatelearn.com`
- [ ] Firebase functions deployed with updated branding
- [ ] Teacher account with access to dashboard

### 🔐 Check Firebase Secrets
```bash
# Verify current secrets configuration
firebase functions:secrets:access SENDER_EMAIL
firebase functions:secrets:access SENDGRID_API_KEY
firebase functions:secrets:access APP_URL
```

**Expected Values:**
- `SENDER_EMAIL`: `noreply@luminatelearn.com`
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY`: Valid SendGrid API key
- `APP_URL`: `https://verse-dev-central.web.app` (or production URL)

## 🔄 **Updated Email Link Authentication Flow**

The system now uses **Firebase Email Link Authentication** instead of password reset links for better user experience:

1. **Email Generation**: Uses `generateSignInWithEmailLink()` instead of `generatePasswordResetLink()`
2. **Custom Password Setup Page**: Routes to `/password-setup` instead of Firebase's hosted UI
3. **Complete Control**: Full branding and user experience control
4. **Seamless Integration**: Auto-redirects to student dashboard after setup
